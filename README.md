# Right to Left Override Attack

This is a really simple example on how to create a file with a unicode right to left ove
rride character used to disguise the real extention of the file.

In this example I disguise my .sh file as a .jpg file.

Of course, this example is harmless - and .sh won't launch from a file explorer in most
cases - but you get how it could be used...
